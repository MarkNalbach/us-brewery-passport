<h1>US Brew Passport — Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to US Brew Passport (“we,” “our,” “the App”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the US Brew Passport mobile application and related services. By creating an account or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least <strong>21 years old</strong> to use this app.  
By using US Brew Passport, you confirm that you are of legal drinking age in your state or region.</p>

<h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>US Brew Passport is a tool for discovering breweries and unlocking exclusive rewards such as discounts, BOGO offers, or other promotions determined by participating breweries.</p>

<p>You may scan each brewery’s unique QR code <strong>one time</strong> per year to redeem its reward. QR codes must be scanned at the brewery, in person, in the presence of brewery staff.</p>

<h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
<p>You must create an account to redeem rewards. By registering, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide accurate and truthful information</li>
  <li>Verify your email address</li>
  <li>Keep your login details secure</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend or delete accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

<h2>4. Location Services (Optional)</h2>
We do not store or track your GPS location.
<p>Some features of the App may request access to your device’s location, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Viewing breweries near your current position</li>
  <li>Getting directions to breweries</li>
  <li>Opening map apps with routing</li>
  li>Centering the map view to your approximate location</li>
</ul>

<p>You may decline location access. The App will still function, but some features may be limited.</p>

<h2>5. One-Time Reward Redemptions</h2>
<p>Each brewery reward may be redeemed <strong>only once per user per calendar year</strong>.  
Attempts to bypass this limitation (e.g., creating multiple accounts) may result in account suspension.</p>

<h2>6. QR Code Scanning</h2>
<p>To redeem a reward, you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be physically present at the participating brewery</li>
  <li>Present the app to brewery staff</li>
  <li>Scan the brewery’s QR code provided onsite</li>
</ul>

<p>US Brew Passport is not responsible for situations in which a brewery declines redemption due to misuse, expired offers, or legal requirements.</p>

<h2>7. Accuracy of Brewery Information</h2>
<p>We strive to keep brewery details updated, but we cannot guarantee accuracy.  
A brewery’s hours, offers, or participation status may change.</p>

<h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the app for unlawful purposes</li>
  <li>Attempt to manipulate redemptions or scan QR codes fraudulently</li>
  <li>Upload harmful content or interfere with app operations</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. No Guarantee of Rewards</h2>
<p>Promotions are offered directly by participating breweries.  
US Brew Passport does not control or guarantee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Availability of specific rewards</li>
  <li>Brewery participation</li>
  <li>Discount amounts or offer details</li>
</ul>

<p>Breweries may modify or withdraw their offers at any time.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You violate these Terms</li>
  <li>You attempt to abuse the reward system</li>
  <li>We detect fraudulent activity</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. App Availability</h2>
<p>We do not guarantee uninterrupted access.  
Maintenance, outages, or changes may occur at any time.</p>

<h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, US Brew Passport is not responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any injury, damage, or loss resulting from use of the app</li>
  <li>Misconduct or policy changes made by breweries</li>
  <li>Incorrect or outdated information</li>
  <li>Your interactions with breweries</li>
</ul>

<h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms occasionally.  
Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
