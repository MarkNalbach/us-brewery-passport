<h1>US Brew Passport — Support</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
Welcome to US Brew Passport support.  
If you have questions, run into issues, or need help using the app, you’re in the right place.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
US Brew Passport lets you discover participating breweries, track visits, and redeem one-time brewery offers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an account and verify your email</li>
  <li>Browse breweries by state or map</li>
  <li>Visit a participating brewery in person</li>
  <li>Scan the brewery’s QR code with staff present</li>
  <li>Redeem your offer (once per brewery, per year)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Why can’t I redeem an offer?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You must be logged in</li>
  <li>You must be physically at the brewery</li>
  <li>The QR code must belong to that brewery</li>
  <li>Each offer can only be redeemed once per brewery per year</li>
</ul>

<h3>I scanned the QR code but nothing happened</h3>
<p>
Make sure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You granted camera permissions</li>
  <li>The QR code is clear and well-lit</li>
  <li>You are scanning the brewery’s official QR code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why don’t I see a brewery I expected?</h3>
<p>
Only participating breweries appear in the app.  
If a brewery recently joined, it may take a short time to appear.
